The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0x8ef8ed9b11481c054bbfccd9037c610b415c3415655c40232ce3daf7a403b230) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
