The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0x100f445178e91f030ae69dcb220cc8c103fd8068eb3f9cb707edac1be60d5184) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
