The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0xa8728cf85cb7167aaa9f8476ed0684a268ce02edf00cc5c09d7919ca88f51c24) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
