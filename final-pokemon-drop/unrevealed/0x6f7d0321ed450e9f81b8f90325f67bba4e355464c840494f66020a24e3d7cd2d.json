The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0x6f7d0321ed450e9f81b8f90325f67bba4e355464c840494f66020a24e3d7cd2d) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
