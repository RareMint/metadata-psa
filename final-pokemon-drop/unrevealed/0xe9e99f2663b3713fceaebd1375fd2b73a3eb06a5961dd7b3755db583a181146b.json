The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0xe9e99f2663b3713fceaebd1375fd2b73a3eb06a5961dd7b3755db583a181146b) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
