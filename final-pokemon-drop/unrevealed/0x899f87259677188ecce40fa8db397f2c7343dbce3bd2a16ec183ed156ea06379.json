The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0x899f87259677188ecce40fa8db397f2c7343dbce3bd2a16ec183ed156ea06379) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
