The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0x1e82c20489c904955d2e8fdc9de68c091540e7daa10764fb6fcc7291aef53549) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
