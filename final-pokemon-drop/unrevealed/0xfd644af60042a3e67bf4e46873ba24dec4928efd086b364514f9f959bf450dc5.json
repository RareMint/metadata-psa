The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0xfd644af60042a3e67bf4e46873ba24dec4928efd086b364514f9f959bf450dc5) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
