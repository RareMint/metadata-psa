The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0x56c662d355bc88ba1f5aaa88a2ceb3afb38c9f7028ce13d563472046c9295499) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
