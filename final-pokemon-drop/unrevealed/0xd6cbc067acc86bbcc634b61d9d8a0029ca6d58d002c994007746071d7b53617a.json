The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0xd6cbc067acc86bbcc634b61d9d8a0029ca6d58d002c994007746071d7b53617a) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
