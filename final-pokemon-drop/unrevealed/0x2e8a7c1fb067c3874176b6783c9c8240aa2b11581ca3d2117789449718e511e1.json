The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0x2e8a7c1fb067c3874176b6783c9c8240aa2b11581ca3d2117789449718e511e1) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
