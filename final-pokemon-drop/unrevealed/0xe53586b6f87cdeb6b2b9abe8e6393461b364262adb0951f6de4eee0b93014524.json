The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0xe53586b6f87cdeb6b2b9abe8e6393461b364262adb0951f6de4eee0b93014524) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
