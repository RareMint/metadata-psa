The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0x4d89643fc1a39326b9783f7ad7ccfd353ed509effab9d6a815e0cbf7a613338a) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
