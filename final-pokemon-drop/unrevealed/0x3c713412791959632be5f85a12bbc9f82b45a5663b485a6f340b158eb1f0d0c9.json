The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0x3c713412791959632be5f85a12bbc9f82b45a5663b485a6f340b158eb1f0d0c9) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
