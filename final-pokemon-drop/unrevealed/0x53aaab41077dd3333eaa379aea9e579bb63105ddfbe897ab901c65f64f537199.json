The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0x53aaab41077dd3333eaa379aea9e579bb63105ddfbe897ab901c65f64f537199) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
