The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0x91307b43955c68dea591ff23e3d611157b63fa38def9f4031d48ae5e365221cc) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
