The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0x8bf4723818280bd5a0e1122983bc213c13057c5f486d763e0af5d5027715a1a9) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
