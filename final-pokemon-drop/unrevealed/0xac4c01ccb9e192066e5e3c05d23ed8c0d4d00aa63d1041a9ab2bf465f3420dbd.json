The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0xac4c01ccb9e192066e5e3c05d23ed8c0d4d00aa63d1041a9ab2bf465f3420dbd) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
