The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0x10ad0abbe3692435a2063c31f74a826c82551a38ab9379f6f6649d597d199e65) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
