The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0xa7c2fd161835f6c3ccfe94de94abbd9199ff773852e15e9441f8a5389362fe7a) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
