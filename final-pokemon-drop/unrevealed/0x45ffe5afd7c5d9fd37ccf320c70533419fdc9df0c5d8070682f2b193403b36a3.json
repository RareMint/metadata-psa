The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0x45ffe5afd7c5d9fd37ccf320c70533419fdc9df0c5d8070682f2b193403b36a3) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
