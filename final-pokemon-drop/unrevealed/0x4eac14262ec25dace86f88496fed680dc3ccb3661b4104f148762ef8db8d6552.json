The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0x4eac14262ec25dace86f88496fed680dc3ccb3661b4104f148762ef8db8d6552) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
