The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0x41e1b421af5b4a40f5fe5805c3a3b68f293f844d1a0201e0013382f84231b5bd) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
