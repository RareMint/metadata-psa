The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0xe526dfc832eac80c6d36d4af93f1cde0bc9523b67c8c734e4207d104ee622a16) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
