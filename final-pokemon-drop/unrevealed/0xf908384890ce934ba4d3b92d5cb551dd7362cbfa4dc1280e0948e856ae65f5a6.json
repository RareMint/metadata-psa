The 1 of 1 NFT contained in this sealed pack is backed by the physical asset in the RareMint Vault. The card was randomly assigned at mint time, along with a unique identifier (0xf908384890ce934ba4d3b92d5cb551dd7362cbfa4dc1280e0948e856ae65f5a6) derived from a fingerprint of the physical asset, which will be revealed at the same time as the NFT itself."
